# plotly_deploy

## OVERVIEW

In this project we are combing through json data for bacteria samples from bellybuttons and using JavaScript and HTML to deploy a webpage that can iterate through our research data and display it comprehensively to viewers using an interactive bar chart, gauge, and bubble chart.

## RESULTS

Using our chart initialize function, bar chart, gauge, and bubble chart functions and reading in/filtering our json data, we managed to deploy a fully functional webpage with dynamic charts and graphs.
